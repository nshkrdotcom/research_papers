**Iterated Summary of Papers (Chronological Order):**

This section provides a summary of each paper, highlighting the evolution of ideas and the iterative refinement of the mathematical frameworks. The order reflects the order presented in the original request.

1.  **`ResearchProposal-DANN.tex` (Decentralized Autonomous Narrative Networks):**
    *   **Focus:** Introduces the core DANN framework. Agents have internal models (akin to LCMs) with knowledge, beliefs, and narratives (sequences of concept embeddings). Veracity, influence, and a basic reward function are defined. Agent switching (using multiple internal models) is proposed.
    *   **Key Equations:** Defines embedding spaces, narrative divergence, knowledge propagation, belief evolution, and a reward function.
    *   **Limitations:** The initial veracity function is relatively simple.  The influence mechanisms are basic.

2.  **`ResearchProposal-DANN_Fertilizer.tex` (AI Gardening):**
    *   **Focus:** Introduces "AI Gardening" – training with low-quality/synthetic data ("fertilizer").  The veracity function is updated to account for fertilizer data.
    *   **Key Equations:** Updates the veracity function and modifies the knowledge propagation and belief evolution equations to incorporate fertilizer.
    *   **Significance:** Explores the idea that robustness can be gained from exposure to noisy and potentially misleading information (similar to how biological systems adapt).

3.  **`ResearchProposal-DANN_Impact.tex` (Impact of DANN):**
    *   **Focus:** A more concise overview of DANN, emphasizing its potential for modeling and mitigating online narrative manipulation.  The document lacks detailed equations compared to others.
    *   **Key Ideas:** Highlights the adversarial context and the need to model reputational damage.
    *   **Limitations:** Less mathematically detailed than other DANN papers.

4.  **`ResearchProposal-DANN-ephemeral.tex` (Ephemeral Knowledge Graphs):**
    *   **Focus:**  Introduces "ephemeral knowledge graphs" – dynamically constructed, query-specific knowledge representations.  The veracity function is enhanced with multi-source fusion and source reliability assessment.
    *   **Key Equations:** Defines ephemeral narrative graphs and provides equations for multi-source veracity and source reliability.
    *   **Significance:**  Moves towards more context-aware and dynamic modeling of information flow.

5. **`ResearchProposal-DANN-Summary.tex` (Behavior Control):**
    * **Focus:** Introduces a *highly ethically problematic* scenario involving behavior control using LCMs and a hypothetical Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for pain/pleasure feedback.  This serves as a stark illustration of potential misuse.
    * **Key Equations:** Integrates a pain/pleasure reward component into the agent's reward function.
    * **Ethical Concerns:**  This paper *explicitly* describes a scenario that raises severe ethical concerns about coercion, manipulation, and the erosion of autonomy.  It should be viewed as a thought experiment demonstrating the *dangers* of certain applications.
    * **This is not a recommended course of action.**

6.  **`ResearchProposal-ChiralNarrativeSynthesis.tex` (Chiral Narrative Synthesis):**
    *   **Focus:** Introduces a new framework (CNS) for truth discovery using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).  Key concepts are *chiral narratives* (opposing but partially valid) and *orthogonal narratives* (independent).  Spiral descent optimization is used.
    *   **Key Equations:**  Defines chiral similarity, orthogonal similarity, and a spiral descent update rule. Includes Bayesian interpretations and conjectures.
    *   **Significance:**  Moves beyond simple narrative interaction to a more complex system aimed at synthesizing information from diverse sources.
