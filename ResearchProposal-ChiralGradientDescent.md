# TODO:

3.  **Methodology Section:** This section should be much more detailed in a proposal.  Instead of describing completed experiments, outline the *planned* methodology. Specify the datasets you will use, the network architectures, the implementation of CGD (including details on how you'll calculate chiral vectors, distances, etc.), the baseline methods you will compare against, and your planned statistical analyses and evaluation metrics. Include a timeline or milestones for completing the research.

4.  **Results and Discussion:**  These sections will be absent or very brief in a proposal, as they describe results that you have yet to generate.  Instead, you can include a section outlining *anticipated results* and their interpretation. You can suggest how your results might support or refute your hypotheses and what potential implications these outcomes might have.

6.  **Add a Timeline/Milestones Section:**  This section is essential for a proposal, outlining the planned steps and their anticipated completion dates.

7.  **Add a Budget (If applicable):** If you're seeking funding, add a budget section detailing the needed computational resources, software licenses, any external collaborations that may be involved, and time dedicated to the project.







To debug your LaTeX document, focus on these areas:

1.  **Missing `references.bib`:** You're citing a source (`induraj2023variants`), but you haven't created a `references.bib` file containing the bibliographic information. Create this file (a BibTeX file) with the details of the cited work.  For example:

    ```bibtex
    @misc{induraj2023variants,
        title={Different Variants of Gradient Descent},
        author={Induraj},
        year={2023},
        howpublished={\url{https://induraj2020.medium.com/different-variants-of-gradient-descent-6854d3118c4c}}
    }
    ```

2.  **Undefined Terms:** In your mathematical formulation, you haven't defined \(\mathbf{c}_{ij}\), \(w_{ij}\), or \(s(w_{ij}, \mathbf{c}_{ij})\).  These are crucial for understanding your algorithm.  Add a subsection *before* the mathematical formulation to define these terms precisely. For example:

    ```latex
    \subsection{Definitions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\mathbf{c}_{ij}\): The chiral vector for the pair of nodes ($v_i, v_j$), representing the direction and magnitude of their chiral relationship.  The precise method of calculating \(\mathbf{c}_{ij}\) based on topological features of the network is described in Section 5.
        \item \(w_{ij}\): A weight associated with the chiral pair ($v_i, v_j\), reflecting the strength of their interaction.  This might be a function of the topological distance or other properties of the chiral relationship.
        \item \(s(w_{ij}, \mathbf{c}_{ij})\): A sigmoid function that modulates the influence of the chiral term based on the weight \(w_{ij}\) and the magnitude of \(\mathbf{c}_{ij}\).  This ensures that nearby chiral pairs have a stronger influence than distant pairs, in line with the biological observation that the strength of neural connections diminishes with distance.  The specific form of this function will be determined experimentally, potentially allowing it to be something more sophisticated or adapted for specific use cases.
    \end{itemize}
    ```

3.  **Clarify `C`:** In your algorithm, you haven't clearly defined how the set of chiral pairs, C, is selected. Will you use all pairs? Will the selection process change dynamically during training?  You need to add a sentence describing your approach and any considerations for choosing these pairs, as suggested in the previous response.

4.  **Expand "Applying Chiral Topologies":** This section is too brief. Provide details on how you will compute the chiral vectors \(\mathbf{c}_{ij}\) and weights \(w_{ij}\) based on topological properties of the network.  Be specific:  How will you measure topological asymmetry?  How will you map this to the chiral vectors?

5.  **Improve Introduction:** The introduction could be more concise and impactful. Start with a compelling statement about the limitations of standard gradient descent, and then directly state the novel approach your work proposes.
