# TODO:

3.  **Methodology Section:** This section should be much more detailed in a proposal.  Instead of describing completed experiments, outline the *planned* methodology. Specify the datasets you will use, the network architectures, the implementation of CGD (including details on how you'll calculate chiral vectors, distances, etc.), the baseline methods you will compare against, and your planned statistical analyses and evaluation metrics. Include a timeline or milestones for completing the research.

4.  **Results and Discussion:**  These sections will be absent or very brief in a proposal, as they describe results that you have yet to generate.  Instead, you can include a section outlining *anticipated results* and their interpretation. You can suggest how your results might support or refute your hypotheses and what potential implications these outcomes might have.

6.  **Add a Timeline/Milestones Section:**  This section is essential for a proposal, outlining the planned steps and their anticipated completion dates.

7.  **Add a Budget (If applicable):** If you're seeking funding, add a budget section detailing the needed computational resources, software licenses, any external collaborations that may be involved, and time dedicated to the project.
