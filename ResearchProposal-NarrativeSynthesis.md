# Equations for Representing and Processing Chiral Narratives

## Known Approaches to Encoding Conflicting Narratives

Drawing from existing knowledge in narrative representation and neural network modeling, several established approaches provide a foundation for representing conflicting narratives:

The cosine similarity between narrative embeddings is commonly used to measure similarity:
```
sim(N_i, N_j) = cos(θ) = (N_i · N_j) / (||N_i|| ||N_j||)
```

Recurrent neural networks often model narrative sequences through hidden state updates:
```
h_t = tanh(W_hx x_t + W_hh h_{t-1} + b_h)
```

Traditional sentiment divergence between narratives can be quantified using:
```
D_sentiment(N_i, N_j) = |sentiment(N_i) - sentiment(N_j)|
```

## Novel Chiral Narrative Equations

### 1. Narrative Chirality Measure

Drawing inspiration from the documents, I propose a chirality measure between two narratives that captures their oppositional yet complementary nature:

```
χ(N_i, N_j) = [1 - |cos(θ_ij)|] · [min(T_i, T_j)] · [1 - JS(P_i || P_j)]
```

Where:
- `cos(θ_ij)` is the cosine similarity between narrative embeddings
- `T_i` and `T_j` are confidence scores for each narrative
- `JS(P_i || P_j)` is the Jensen-Shannon divergence between probability distributions over world states

This equation captures three important aspects of chirality:
1. Directional opposition (low absolute cosine similarity)
2. Minimum confidence threshold (both narratives must have some validity)
3. Distributional complementarity (different but not completely unrelated beliefs)

### 2. Spiral Descent for Narrative Convergence

For converging chiral narratives toward truth, I propose a spiral descent function:

```
N_t+1 = N_t - α∇L(N_t) + β∑_(i,j∈C) w_ij·(∇L(N_t) × c_ij)·e^(-γd(N_t,T))
```

Where:
- `N_t` is the narrative embedding at time t
- `∇L(N_t)` is the loss gradient with respect to truth
- `C` is the set of identified chiral pairs
- `c_ij` is the chiral vector between narratives i and j
- `w_ij` is the weight of the chiral relationship
- `d(N_t,T)` is the distance to the estimated truth embedding
- `α`, `β`, and `γ` are hyperparameters

This equation introduces a rotational component that becomes weaker as the narrative approaches truth.

### 3. Bayesian Narrative Synthesis

For synthesizing information from chiral narratives, I propose:

```
P(W|N_i,N_j) = [P(W|N_i)^{T_i} · P(W|N_j)^{T_j}]^{1/(T_i+T_j)} · Z^{-1}
```

Where:
- `P(W|N_i)` is the probability distribution over world states given narrative i
- `T_i` is the confidence score for narrative i
- `Z` is a normalization constant

This weighted geometric mean respects the confidence scores while creating a synthesized distribution.

### 4. Orthogonality-Chirality Space Projection

To visualize the relationship between narratives:

```
O(N_i,N_j) = √(1 - χ(N_i,N_j)²)
```

Where:
- `O(N_i,N_j)` is the orthogonality measure
- `χ(N_i,N_j)` is the chirality measure

This creates a unit circle mapping for any narrative pair, where perfect chirality is at (1,0) and perfect orthogonality at (0,1).

### 5. Multi-Agent Convergence Rate

To measure how quickly a multi-agent system with chiral narratives converges:

```
CR(t) = -d/dt[∑_i w_i·d(N_i(t),T(t))]
```

Where:
- `d(N_i(t),T(t))` is the distance from narrative i to truth at time t
- `w_i` is the weight/importance of agent i

### 6. Weighted Narrative Synthesis with Spatiotemporal Verification

Incorporating the spatiotemporal digest concept:

```
N_synthesized = ∑_i [N_i · T_i · V(R_i,S_i)] / ∑_i [T_i · V(R_i,S_i)]
```

Where:
- `V(R_i,S_i)` is the verification score (0 or 1) from comparing raster recording R with spatiotemporal digest S

### 7. Information Gain from Chiral Resolution

The expected information gain from resolving a chiral pair:

```
IG(N_i,N_j) = H(W) - [T_i·H(W|N_i) + T_j·H(W|N_j) - χ(N_i,N_j)·I(N_i;N_j)]
```

Where:
- `H(W)` is the entropy of world state distribution
- `H(W|N_i)` is the conditional entropy given narrative i
- `I(N_i;N_j)` is the mutual information between narratives

This equation suggests that resolving highly chiral narratives with low mutual information yields the highest information gain.

### 8. Dynamic Imperviousness Threshold Function

Adapting from the first document's concept of imperviousness:

```
Imp(N_i,t) = 1/(1+e^{-k·(R(N_i,t)-R_M)})
```

Where:
- `R(N_i,t)` is the resource/backing of narrative i at time t
- `R_M` is the midpoint threshold
- `k` controls the steepness of the sigmoid function

This captures how well-resourced narratives become impervious to contradictory evidence.

These equations provide a mathematical framework for analyzing, synthesizing, and reasoning about chiral narratives in multi-agent systems. They draw inspiration from topology, Bayesian inference, information theory, and gradient-based optimization while extending these concepts to address the unique challenges of narrative representation and truth discovery.
