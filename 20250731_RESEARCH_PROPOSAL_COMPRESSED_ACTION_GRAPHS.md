### **Research Proposal: Project Chrysalis**

**Title:** "Compressed Action Graphs: A Novel Architecture for Deterministic, High-Complexity LLM Agent Workflows"

**Abstract:**
Current LLM-powered agents suffer from a combinatorial explosion problem when planning complex, multi-step tasks with conditional logic. Generating every possible action chain (2^n combinations) is intractable. This research proposes the **Compressed Action Graph (CAG)**, a novel data structure that represents a vast, multi-dimensional space of possible tool-call workflows in a highly compressed, overlapping format. We hypothesize that an LLM can be specifically fine-tuned to generate and interpret paths within this compressed graph, rather than generating verbose, linear action chains from scratch. This experiment outlines the theory, construction, and testing of the CAG architecture, aiming to prove that this approach leads to significant gains in execution speed, determinism, and a reduction in the "cache miss" rate for complex agent tasks.

### **1. Theoretical Foundation and Problem Statement**

The core challenge is one of representation. An LLM agent planning a task like "Add a new GraphQL endpoint for user profiles, including database migration, service logic, authentication checks, and unit tests" is navigating a massive decision tree.

*   **Naive Approach:** The agent makes a series of LLM calls, one for each step, creating a single, linear path through the tree. This is slow and prone to error propagation.
*   **Simple Caching:** Caching the full, linear path for "add user endpoint" is brittle. A slight variation (e.g., "add a *product* endpoint") would result in a cache miss, even though 90% of the workflow is identical.
*   **The Combinatorial Explosion:** Pre-rendering all possible paths is impossible. The number of combinations of tools, parameters, and conditional branches is astronomically large.

**Our Proposed Solution: The Compressed Action Graph (CAG)**

The CAG is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:
*   **Nodes:** Represent a single, parameterized tool call (e.g., `writeFile(path, content)`).
*   **Edges:** Represent a transition. They can be **unconditional** (always proceed to the next node) or **conditional** (proceed only if a condition, like `fileExists(path)`, is met).
*   **The Novelty (Compression):** Multiple logical paths *share the same nodes*. The "add user endpoint" and "add product endpoint" workflows would diverge at the start (different model names, fields) but *converge* on the same nodes for tasks like "run database migration tool" or "add route to server configuration." This sharing is the essence of the compression. It avoids redundant storage of common sub-workflows.

The CAG is therefore a "multi-dimensional hashmap" where a single entry point can lead to an exponential number of potential unpacked chains, but the stored representation is compact and reuses components.

### **2. Research Hypotheses**

*   **H1 (Representation Efficiency):** The CAG data structure can represent a large set of complex, conditional workflows with significantly lower storage complexity than storing each workflow as an independent, linear chain.
*   **H2 (LLM Specialization):** An LLM fine-tuned to output a "path descriptor" within a given CAG will generate valid, complex action plans with higher accuracy and lower token count than a general-purpose LLM generating a verbose tool sequence from scratch.
*   **H3 (Performance):** A system utilizing a CAG and a specialized LLM will demonstrate orders-of-magnitude lower latency on "cache hits" and a measurably decreasing "cache miss" rate over time as it learns and incorporates new paths into the compressed graph.

### **3. Experimental Design and Methodology**

This experiment is structured in four distinct phases.

**Phase 1: Testbed Construction & CAG Formalization**

1.  **Select Target Codebase:** Choose a moderately complex, well-structured open-source project (e.g., a NodeJS backend like `Express.js` with a defined project structure, or a Python Django application). This provides a realistic environment.
2.  **Implement the `Codebase Analyzer`:** Build the tool that performs static analysis and mines version control history to identify common, recurring action patterns.
3.  **Manual & Semi-Automated CAG Generation:**
    *   Manually map out 5-10 core, complex workflows of the target codebase (e.g., "add new model," "create new API route," "deprecate a feature").
    *   Visualize these workflows as uncompressed graphs.
    *   Develop the **Compression Algorithm**. This is a key research contribution. The algorithm must identify common sub-graphs (sequences of nodes and edges) across the different workflows and merge them, creating a single, unified CAG. This is analogous to common subexpression elimination in compilers.
    .
4.  **Formalize the CAG Representation:** Define the data structure for the CAG (e.g., using JSON or Protobuf) and the "Path Descriptor" language. A path descriptor might look like `[node_id_1, node_id_5, {if: cond_A, then: node_id_8, else: node_id_9}, node_id_12]`. This is the compressed output the LLM will learn to generate.

**Phase 2: LLM Training Dataset Generation**

1.  **Path Unspooling:** From the "gold standard" CAG created in Phase 1, computationally generate thousands of valid paths.
2.  **Prompt Generation:** For each unspooled path, use another LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate a variety of high-level, natural language prompts that describe the intent of that path.
    *   *Example Path:* Create user model, create user service, create user controller, add route.
    *   *Generated Prompts:* "scaffold a new user resource," "add a user endpoint," "I need to manage users through the API."
3.  **Create the Training Dataset:** The final dataset will consist of pairs: `(natural_language_prompt, compressed_path_descriptor)`. This is the critical step. We are teaching the LLM to map human intent directly to the compressed representation of the solution.

**Phase 3: LLM Fine-Tuning and Evaluation**

1.  **Model Selection:** Choose a powerful, fine-tunable base LLM (e.g., Gemini, Llama 3).
2.  **Control Group:** A baseline model using the same base LLM, but prompted in a standard, reactive "ReAct" framework without knowledge of the CAG. It will be given the same prompts and context.
3.  **Experimental Group:** Fine-tune the base LLM on the dataset generated in Phase 2. The model's objective is to minimize the difference between its generated path descriptor and the ground-truth descriptor.
4.  **Training:** Execute the fine-tuning process on a GPU cluster.

**Phase 4: Integration, Benchmarking, and Measurement**

1.  **Build the Runtime Environment:** Implement the `Action Cache` (which stores the CAG) and the `Execution Engine` that can interpret a `path descriptor` and execute the corresponding tool calls.
2.  **Benchmark Suite:** Create a held-out test set of prompts, including:
    *   **In-distribution prompts:** Similar to the training data (expected cache hits).
    *   **Out-of-distribution prompts:** Novel tasks that will require a "cache miss" and full LLM reasoning.
3.  **Execute Benchmark:**
    *   Run the suite against the **Control System**.
    *   Run the suite against the **Experimental System (Chrysalis)**.
4.  **Measure and Analyze:** Collect data on the metrics defined below.

### **4. Metrics for Evaluation**

*   **To Test H1 (Compression):**
    *   **`Compression Ratio`:** `size(uncompressed_workflows) / size(compressed_cag)`. A higher ratio is better.

*   **To Test H2 (Accuracy):**
    *   **`Syntactic Validity`:** Percentage of generated path descriptors that are valid according to the CAG's structure.
    *   **`Semantic Correctness`:** Percentage of valid paths that correctly fulfill the user's prompt. Judged by human evaluators.

*   **To Test H3 (Performance):**
    *   **`Latency (Cache Hit)`:** Time from prompt submission to first tool execution for in-distribution tasks. Expect this to be <50ms for the experimental system vs. multiple seconds for the control.
    *   **`Cache Miss Rate`:** Percentage of prompts requiring the fallback to a full, real-time LLM call.
    *   **`Learning Rate`:** Measure the decrease in the `Cache Miss Rate` over time as the results of miss-handled prompts are used to augment the CAG and retrain the model.

### **5. Expected Outcomes and Impact**

This experiment would be a landmark in agent architecture. A successful outcome would provide the first concrete blueprint for building AI agents that can handle truly complex tasks with the speed and reliability of traditionally compiled software. The concept of training an LLM on a compressed, domain-specific action space is a powerful paradigm shift that could be applied to other domains, such as scientific discovery workflows, business process automation, and complex UI interactions. Project Chrysalis aims to provide the theory, the methodology, and the empirical proof for this next generation of AI agents.
