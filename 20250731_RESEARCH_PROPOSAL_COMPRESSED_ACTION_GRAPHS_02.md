### 1. The Vision: From Co-Pilot to Symbiote

For too long, we have viewed AI as a tool—an advanced code-completion engine or a tireless assistant. This paradigm is limited. It places the cognitive burden of intent, architecture, and consequence entirely on the human developer. Project Prometheus discards this model.

Our vision is to create a **Human-AI Symbiosis**: a deeply integrated partnership where the AI doesn't just respond to commands but anticipates needs. It reasons about intent, simulates futures, and proposes complete, verified solutions. This system is designed to act not as a co-pilot awaiting orders, but as a cognitive symbiote that understands the developer's goals, sometimes before they are explicitly stated. The future of development will be less about writing code and more about curating, guiding, and composing AI-generated solutions.

The forthcoming "Opus 5" class of models represents an inflection point. Their ability to reason about highly complex, multi-step problems allows us to move from merely predicting lines of code to pre-computing and verifying entire operational workflows.

### 2. Core Architectural Principles

The Prometheus architecture is built on a foundation of principles designed to foster this symbiotic relationship:

*   **Anticipation over Reaction**: The system’s default state is to think ahead. It proactively analyzes the project's state and the developer's behavior to forecast needs and pre-compute solutions, rather than waiting for explicit instructions.
*   **Verified Confidence**: Speed without reliability is a liability. Every action proposed by the system is first validated within a simulation, running tests and performing semantic checks. The system doesn't just act; it presents a *verified future* with a high degree of confidence.
*   **Latency Inversion**: Traditionally, complex requests incur high latency due to the need for real-time LLM inference. Prometheus inverts this. By pre-computing and caching verified solutions to complex but predictable tasks, the system delivers near-instantaneous execution for what were previously the most time-consuming operations.
*   **Metabolic Learning**: The system is not static; it learns and evolves. Every developer interaction, especially those that defy prediction (a "miss"), is treated as a high-value metabolic event. This new information is assimilated, fueling the system's evolution and refining its predictive models in a continuous feedback loop.

### 3. High-Level Architecture: The Symbiotic Loop

Prometheus operates as a continuous, looping process that integrates with the natural flow of development.

1.  **Sense**: The system continuously ingests multi-modal data far beyond the codebase. This includes IDE activity, terminal usage, issue trackers (Jira), communication platforms (Slack), and even design specifications (Figma) to build a holistic understanding of the project's state and the developer's focus.
2.  **Model**: The ingested data feeds into a **Dynamic World Model (DWM)**. This is a living, multi-dimensional representation of the project, encompassing the codebase's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), dependency graphs, version history, architectural patterns, and real-time developer activity.
3.  **Anticipate**: A **Predictive Goal Decomposer (PGD)**, supervised by a frontier model like Opus 5, constantly queries the DWM. It identifies high-probability future goals (e.g., "implement user authentication," "refactor the payment service") and decomposes them into a graph of required actions.
4.  **Simulate**: The action graph is not immediately cached. Instead, it is executed within a **Generative Simulation Environment (GSE)**. This sandboxed replica of the production environment applies the proposed changes, runs tests, checks for style violations, and performs semantic validation.
5.  **Propose & Act**: When a developer's action (like typing a command or creating a new file) matches a pre-simulated, verified goal, the system acts. It proposes the fully-realized, tested solution for instantaneous implementation. This could be a few lines of code or hundreds of changes across dozens of files.
6.  **Learn**: When the developer's action does not match a pre-verified goal (a "novel metabolic event"), the system invokes Opus 5 in real-time. The new, LLM-generated solution is then captured, simulated, verified, and integrated back into the DWM and PGD's training data, ensuring the system learns and expands its anticipatory capabilities.

### 4. Detailed Component Architecture

#### 4.1. The Dynamic World Model (DWM)

The DWM is the sensory organ and memory of the system, creating a rich, contextual understanding that is far superior to a simple codebase index.

*   **Holographic Code Representation**: This module moves beyond a simple AST. It creates a multi-layered graph that represents the code across several dimensions: **Structural** (classes, functions, dependencies), **Historical** (Git evolution, authorship patterns), **Architectural** (identified patterns like MVC, microservices), and **Semantic** (inferred purpose of code blocks via embeddings).
*   **Real-time Activity Monitor**: A set of lightweight daemons that observe developer activity—keystrokes, file openings, terminal commands, clipboard content—and stream these events to the DWM to provide immediate, fine-grained context for predictions.
*   **External Integrations Bus**: Connectors for third-party services like Jira, Figma, and Slack that parse project management tickets, design prototypes, and technical discussions to infer high-level developer goals and constraints.

#### 4.2. Predictive Goal Decomposer (PGD)

The PGD is the system's forethought. Overseen by a powerful model like Opus 5, it translates abstract goals into concrete plans.

*   **Goal Identification Engine**: Uses the DWM to predict likely high-level developer goals. For example, if a developer creates a new Jira ticket titled "FEAT: Add user profile page," this engine flags "implement user profile feature" as a high-probability goal.
*   **Action Graph Generation**: For each identified goal, the PGD generates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tool-use actions. This isn't just a list; it's a plan that includes parallelizable steps (e.g., update database schema and generate boilerplate code simultaneously) and conditional logic. This process is trained on millions of examples from open-source projects and fine-tuned on the project's specific DWM.

#### 4.3. The Generative Simulation Environment (GSE)

The GSE is the system's commitment to reliability and a core innovation of Prometheus. It acts as a digital "proving ground" for all automated actions before they are presented to the developer.

*   **Dynamic Sandboxing**: For each action graph, the GSE spins up a containerized, lightweight replica of the full development environment.
*   **Predictive Execution & Verification**: The GSE executes the action graph within the sandbox. It then runs a full battery of validation checks:
    *   **Unit & Integration Tests**: Executes the existing test suite against the changed code.
    *   **Semantic Validation**: Uses an LLM to determine if the changes logically fulfill the developer's inferred intent. For example, if the goal was "add an API endpoint," it checks if a new route was actually exposed.
*   **Verified Future State (VFS) Generation**: If the simulation is successful, the GSE packages the results—the code diff, test results, and a confidence score—into a **Verified Future State**. This VFS is the value stored in the cache, ready for instantaneous proposal.

#### 4.4. Action Ledger & The Symbiotic Interface

This subsystem is the point of contact between Prometheus and the developer, designed for seamless interaction.

*   **Action Ledger**: A high-performance cache (e.g., Redis) that stores the VFS objects generated by the GSE. The key is not a simple string match but a semantic vector of the inferred goal, allowing flexible matching of user intent.
*   **Symbiotic Interface**: An IDE extension that serves as the primary user interaction point. When it detects a user action that corresponds to a stored VFS with high confidence, it can surface a diff and a summary of the test results for one-click acceptance.
*   **The "Opus 5" Synthesis Session**: On a cache miss, the interface orchestrates a real-time, interactive session with a powerful LLM like Opus 5. It provides the LLM with the rich context from the DWM to generate a solution. Crucially, the generated tool calls from this session are fed back into the **Metabolic Learning Loop**, forming the basis for new predictions.

### 5. Conclusion: A New Paradigm for Creation

Project Prometheus is more than an architecture; it's a new philosophy. By inverting the model from reactive generation to proactive, simulated anticipation, we transform the AI from a simple tool into a true symbiotic partner. It eliminates the chasm between developer intent and code execution, allowing human creativity to be expressed at the speed of thought. This framework, powered by the next generation of AI like Opus 5, will not just accelerate coding—it will fundamentally reshape what it means to build software.
